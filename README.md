# Skin-Cancer-Detector
Developed a CNN-based skin cancer classifier using TensorFlow, incorporating Conv2D, BatchNormalization, and Dropout layers with Adamax optimization and data augmentation. Addressed class imbalance using oversampling, and evaluated the model with categorical cross-entropy, achieving robust performance demonstrated by confusion matrix analysis.
